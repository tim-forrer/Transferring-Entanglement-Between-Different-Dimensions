\subsection{Further Steps}
\label{subsection:furthersteps}
As discussed in Section \ref{subsection:furtheruses}, the circuit given in Figure \ref{fig:aqc_circuit_schematic} has potential uses beyond the original scope in which is has been designed.
It would be of interest to see if it can also be applied to a scenario where we wish to transfer multipartite entanglement to higher dimensional qudits, for example transferring GHZ states or W states.
Such analysis should be relatively straightforward to generalise to the multipartite scenario, although extending computational simulations may not be so trivial without adequate computational power.
Furthermore, the analysis of this work could be brought to greater completion if the circuit was generalised to the scenario where we wish to store qudit states rather than just qubit states.
