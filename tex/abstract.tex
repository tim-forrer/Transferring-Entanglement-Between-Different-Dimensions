    Quantum random walks have been an area of significant interest over the past two decades within quantum computation and information. They exhibit many desirable qualities that aid quantum computations and are extremely versatile for use in the design of quantum algorithms. In this report we analyse a recent publication that uses quantum walk dynamics in order to generate higher dimensional entangled states.
