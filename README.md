# Transferring Entanglement Between Different Dimensions

## [Master's Thesis](../blob/master/Masters_Thesis.pdf)

The thesis was submitted on 21st April, 2021 as part of my MSci Natural Sciences degree at Durham University, UK.

### Abstract

>Entangled qudit states, which share higher dimensional entanglement, enable quantum computers to unlock greater advantages in the computations that they are able to perform.
>As such, the generation of these entangled states is a worthy problem to consider as quantum computing technology becomes more and more advanced.
>Many methods of generating Bell pair entangled qubits have been proposed and realised, but schemes for qudit pairs of arbitrary dimension are not as well-researched.
>A protocol utilising quantum walk dynamics has been proposed to repeatedly transfer bipartite entanglement from Bell pairs to be accumulated in qudit pairs.
>Analysis of this protocol shows that this transfer is not optimal when using true quantum walk dynamics.
>Due to its non-unitary nature, it is also not easily reversed to retrieve entanglement from higher dimensional entangled states.
>Post-selection is also needed, where states are sometimes discarded and the entire protocol has to be repeated.
>An adapted version of the protocol, given as a circuit of gates conforming to ancilla-based quantum computing constraints rather than quantum walk ones, is proposed as an alternative which is able to achieve optimal entanglement transfer.
>It allows for entanglement to be transferred freely between qubit and qudit pairs as it is fully unitary and hence reversible.
>Furthermore, it is shown that with the addition of a single gate, the circuit can be used to turn qudits into a form of quantum random access memory.
